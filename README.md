# Kymera

Kymera is a distributed system build on ZeroMQ for running Cucumber tests across a network.
If you are at this page, first let me say Thank You for your interest.  That being said, the Kymera gem
is in a very early stage of development and is currently build specifically for use in DAT Solutions© internal testing infrastructure.
I plan to make this more generic so it can be used with other systems, but for now the goal is to get something working for DAT Solutions©
If you are still are interested, please download the source code and hack away.
