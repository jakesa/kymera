1. take the results and parse them into an array with new line (\n) as the delimiter
2. iterate over the array
3. if line starts with "Using"
    3a. create a string variable with an open div hmtl tag with the class feature
    3b. append a open paragraph html tag to that variable
    3c. append the line to the variable

4. until line starts with "Using"
    4a. move to the next line
    4b. if the line contains \e
        4c. iterate over the line and for every \e do the following
            4d. if the next 3 characters match 36m
                4e. append an open span tag to the string variable with the style color blue
            4f. if the next 3 characters match 90m
                4g.append an open span tag to the string variable with the style color gray
            4h. if the next 3 characters match 31m
                    4i. append an open span tag to the string variable with the style color red
            4j  if the next 3 characters match 0m
                    4k. append a closing span tag to the string variable and start again at step 4a
            4l. if there are no other instances of \e
                    4m. append the remainder of the line and a close span tag to the string variable
            4n. if there are more instances of \e
                    4o. until you reach the next instance of \e
                        4p. continue iterating over the line, appending each character to the sting variable
                    4q. when you reach the next instance of \e start again at step 4d

                    add check for characters after 0m
